# Cluster-Analysis-for-Customer-Segmentation-With-Open-Banking-Data

This repository contains part of the code used for "Cluster Analysis for Customer Segmentation With Open Banking Data" (ASSE 2022). The used datasets were from Open Banking UK, but were not allowed to shared and therefore, some adjustments have been made (e.g. cell output was cleared, certain terms changed). 
The code is released for transparency and replication purposes and has not been extensively cleaned. 

The paper can be found under: https://doi.org/10.1145/3523181.3523194
