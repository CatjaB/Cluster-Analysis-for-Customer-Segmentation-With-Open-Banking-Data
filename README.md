# Cluster-Analysis-for-Customer-Segmentation-With-Open-Banking-Data

This repository contains the part of the code used for "Cluster Analysis for Customer Segmentation With Open Banking Data" (ASSE 2022). The data used were datasets from Open Banking, but were not allowed to shared and therefore, some adjustments have been made (e.g. cell output was cleared, certain terms changed). 
The code is released for transparency and replication purposes and has not been extensively cleaned.
